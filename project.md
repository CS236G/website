#### Class Project Deliverables

##### 20%, Proposal
* Inspo: Find sources of inspiration that you think are cool. You must include 7 sources, at least 2 of which must be academic papers, and write a brief paragraph on each. In your paragraph, give a brief mention of the sources that *they* relied on. You will be assessed on the diversity of material (to prevent student mode collapse :D).
* Idea spew: Create a list of 2+ project ideas you'd be interested in exploring. In each, you must include the dataset you plan to use, the model architecture, and the real-world application this will be used towards. At least two of the three among {dataset, model, application} must be novel. A novel dataset is one which has never had a GAN applied to it (we encourage you to get creative / scrape the data yourself).

##### 15%, Milestone 1 
* I haz the data: Your dataset will be submitted as part of our course's "data stash". We get really psyched when we have a good stash. üí´
* Inkling: Run a baseline model on your data and get cracking!

##### 15%, Milestone 2
* Ignition on: You should have largely implemented the plan you set sail for ‚õµÔ∏è (or an alternative prospect that you pivoted to).
* Star-gazer: Describe some highly risky experiments that you plan to perform. The more the merrier! ü§©

##### 50%, Final Draft
* Team Playa: Equal participation within your pair (N/A if flying solo). This to reduce the case where one person does all the work, and make it a bit easier on an individual.
* Virtually-famous: Submit a video no longer than two minutes about your project.
* Don Quixote: Give the results of the quixotic experiments that you mentioned in Milestone 2. This will be weighted heavily as we want to encourage fearless exploration - don't worry if experiments don't pan out!
