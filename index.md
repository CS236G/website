title: CS236G Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
description: GANs have rapidly emerged as the state-of-the-art technique in realistic image generation. You'll start with basic GANs and learn all the way up to their state-of-the-art forms. The applications span realistic image editing that is omnipresent in popular app filters, enabling tumor classification under low data schemes in medicine, and visualizing realistic scenarios of climate change destruction. You'll also get to examine key challenges of GANs today, including reliable evaluation, inherent biases, and training stability. After this course, students should be familiar with GANs and the broader generative models and machine learning contexts in which these models are situated.

## Course Information
- This quarter ({{ site.course.quarter }}), CS236G meets for in-class lecture {{ site.course.time}}, {{ site.course.venue }}.
- All class communication happens on the [CS236G Piazza forum]({{ site.course.piazza }}). For private matters, please make a private note visible only to the course instructors. For longer discussions with TAs and to get help in person, we strongly encourage you to come to office hours. If you need to contact us via email, please email individual TAs.
- The course content and deadlines for all assignments are listed in our [syllabus](/syllabus).
- For general inquiries, please contact <{{ site.course.qa }}>.

## Course Goals
- Learn and build generative adversarial networks (GANs), from their simplest form to state-of-the-art models. 
- Implement, debug, and train GANs as part of a novel and substantial course project.
- Gaining familiarity with the latest cutting-edge literature on GANs.
- Reward risk-taking and creative exploration.

## Course Components
* In class lecture - once a week on {{ site.course.time}} (hosted on [Zoom](https://stanford.zoom.us/j/95170971060?pwd=bnNFU1pBWExlUlVUdDQ0RnNsYWQvQT09)). 
* Video lectures, programming assignments, and quizzes on Coursera
* [The final project](/project)
* [Weekly TA-led sections](/section)

## Prerequisites
Students are expected to have the following background:
 * Familiarity with basic programming (CS106B or CS101)
 * Familiarity with basics of deep learning (CS230 or CS221)
 * Familiarity with the probability theory (CS 109 or STATS 116)
 * Familiarity with linear algebra (MATH 51)

## Grading

Here's more information about the class grade:

#### Breakdown
 
* 50%: Class project - creativity and equal participation within a group will be rewarded
* 25%: Midterm
* 25%: Programming assignments & quizzes
* 0%: Attendance
* Extra credit: Your (or your GAN-generated) Memes. Requirements: Relevant and Appropriate with capital R and A there.

#### Students with Documented Disabilities
Students who may need an academic accommodation based on the impact of a disability must initiate the request with the [Office of Accessible Education](https://oae.stanford.edu/) (OAE). Professional staff will evaluate the request with required documentation, recommend reasonable accommodations, and prepare an Accommodation Letter for faculty. Unless the student has a temporary disability, Accommodation letters are issued for the entire academic year. Students should contact the OAE as soon as possible since timely notice is needed to coordinate accommodations. The OAE is located at 563 Salvatierra Walk (phone: 723-1066).

#### Honor code
We strongly encourage students to form study groups. Students may discuss and work on programming assignments and quizzes in groups. However, each student must write down the solutions independently, and without referring to written notes from the joint session. In other words, each student must understand the solution well enough in order to reconstruct it by him/herself. In addition, each student should submit his/her own code and mention anyone he/she collaborated with. It is also an honor code violation to copy, refer to, or look at written or code solutions from a previous year, including but not limited to: official solutions from a previous year, solutions posted online, and solutions you or someone else may have written up in a previous year. Furthermore, it is an honor code violation to post your assignment solutions online, such as on a public git repo.
