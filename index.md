title: CS236G Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
description: GANs have rapidly emerged as the state-of-the-art technique in realistic image generation. Its applications span realistic image editing that is omnipresent in popular app filters, enabling tumor classification under low data schemes in medicine, and visualizing realistic scenarios of climate change destruction. You'll also get to examine key challenges of GANs today, including reliable evaluation, inherent biases, and training stability. After this course, students should be familiar with GANs and the broader generative models and machine learning contexts in which these models are situated.

## Course Information
- This quarter ({{ site.course.quarter }}), CS236G meets for in-class lecture {{ site.course.time}}, {{ site.course.venue }}.
- All class communication happens on the [CS236G Piazza forum]({{ site.course.piazza }}). For private matters, please make a private note visible only to the course instructors. For longer discussions with TAs and to get help in person, we strongly encourage you to come to office hours. If you need to contact us via email, please email individual TAs.
- The course content and deadlines for all assignments are listed in our [syllabus](/syllabus).
- For general inquiries, please contact <{{ site.course.qa }}>.

## Course Goals
- Learn and build generative adversarial networks (GANs), from their simplest form to state-of-the-art models. 
- Implement, debug, and train GANs as part of a novel and substantial course project.
- Gaining familiarity with the latest cutting-edge literature on GANs.
- Reward risk-taking and creative exploration.

## Course Components
* In class lectures - twice a week on {{ site.course.time}} (hosted on {{ site.course.venue }}). 
* Video lectures, programming assignments, and quizzes on Coursera
* [The final project](/project)

## Auditing

All students who are looking to audit the course should complete and submit the following [form](https://forms.gle/bynot3sy8smWKf2V8). You should receive an invitation to the course's Canvas and the Coursera course in your Stanford email within 24-48 hours of submitting this form. Make a private piazza post (preferred) or email <{{ site.course.qa }}> if you did receive get the invitations.
